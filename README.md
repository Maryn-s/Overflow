# Overflow

Overflow is an addon for Endless Sky that adds new maps, races, factions, ships, outfits and missions as well as new fun mechanics.

Overflow is NOT an expansion to Endless Sky. Instead Overflow breaks away from Endless Sky, using its own lore and style and introduces new philosophies to the game. The player will spend a large majority away from the Milky Way galaxy.
